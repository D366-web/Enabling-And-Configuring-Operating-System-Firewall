# Enabling-And-Configuring-Operating-System-Firewall
This project demonstrates the steps to enable and configure the operarting system firewall on Window. The goal of this project is to provide comprehensive guide on securing window by configuring the firewall to allow or block incoming and outgoing network traffic.

What is a Firewall?
A firewall is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorized access to entering a private network by filitering the information that comes in from the internet. 
The purpose of a firewall is to create a safety barrier between a private network and a public network.

Project Overview
In this project, i will walk through the process of:

1. Enabling the window operating system firewall to improve security
2. Configuring firewall rules
3. Allowing or blocking programs and applications. 


To get started, access your operating systemâ€™s firewall settings by following these steps:

1. Open the Settings menu, then navigate to the Window Security section and click on it.

 2. You'll see three types of network profiles: Public, Private, and Domain. Pick the one you want to change.

3.  Decide whether you want to block traffic coming in (incoming) or going out (outgoing).

Step 3: Testing the firewall rule
To ensure the firewall rule is working correctly, you can test it by attempting to access a service running on the blocked port. Follow these steps:  

1. Launch the browser for which you applied the rule in step 2.
2. If the firewall rule is configured correctly, you should receive an error message indicating that the connection was blocked.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated the process of enabling and configuring the built-in firewall on Window Operating System. It included locating the firewall settings, activating the firewall, and creating a rule to block a specific program. The steps followed highlight essential skills for managing network security and protecting digital environments from unauthorized access.
